# About Me

Hi, I'm Jason Liu. I am currently a senior (class of 2021) at Montgomery Blair High School. In the summer of 2020, I worked as an intern for the [Laboratory of Cognition & Emotion](http://www.lce.umd.edu/index.html) at the University of Maryland under Dr. Luiz Pessoa. During this time, I worked on developing machine learning models and neural networks to analyze brain data. This website serves as a documentation of the work that I have done during this internship.
